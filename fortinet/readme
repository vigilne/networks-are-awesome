This folder contains a collection of python scripts used with Fortinet Fortigate firewalls FortiOS.

fortigate_backup.py - This script will copy the running configuration file from the fortigate to a text file on a server
                     and append a date stamp to the filename. This script includes exception handling for devices that fail
                     to authenticate or time out when trying to connect. The script requires a seperate text file containing
                     ip addresses of the firewalls to connect to.
